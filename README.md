## Overview
We need to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In order to solidify the proposal, I would like to present a bike trip analysis for our potential investors. With the visualizations I created in Tableau I will be able to make our potential investors realize how profitable our bike sharing service might be. 

## Results
### User profile

Out of 2,334,224 rides 1,900,359 were completed by our subscribers - it's more than 80% of the total amount. It indicates that we have our loyal customers who are going to return to ride with us again. 

### Gender Breakdown

1,530,272 rides were completed by male users (65% of our total), 225,521 rides by - female users (a bit under 10%), 588,431 rides (25%) - gender unknown. It's safe to assume that we have more male users than female - we might need to cme up with. a strategy to attract more female users.

### Checkout Times per User

As we can see our customers predominantly use bikes for short rides - 5 min and under. Not a lot of people choose to ride our bikes for 20 min or longer - the amount of rides declines rapidly as the ride duration increases.  

### Checkout Times per Gender

If we break down our rides by gender we can notice that male rides account  for the greatest amount of those rides shorter than 60 min - past that point gender makes absolutely no difference.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

<img width="369" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-15 at 3 21 32 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73204192/107929286-6ef76400-6f47-11eb-83b0-8643da37920f.png">

Based on our data, there are more male users than female every single day of the week, and Thursday is the busiest day of the week for both women and men.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour 

<img width="521" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-15 at 3 22 27 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73204192/107929788-242a1c00-6f48-11eb-9538-c54a8c5c009b.png">

It is clear that 8 am is the most popular time to bike during weekdays. In the evenings, only Monday, Tuesday and Thursday rides between 5 and 6 pm are popular, Wednesday and Friday  being the two exceptions. On the weekends customers prefer to ride from 10 am to 7 pm.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour, Gendered

<img width="888" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-15 at 3 22 07 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73204192/107930502-11641700-6f49-11eb-83ba-2cda1034a102.png">

This visualization proves that male rides dominate - safe to assume we have a lot more male customers. Ride patterns for men follow the same trend as our previous viz - namely men ride a lot (more than any other time) at 8 am during the week and from 5 to 6 pm on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. On the weekends men mostly ride from 10 am to 6 pm , the same is true for women. Unlike men, women don't ride during the week as much as they do on the weekends. 


## Summary
We have established that our service is a lot more popular among men as the amount of male rides is considerably higher. We have also determined that there are certain patterns for men and women - men tend to ride the most during weekdays at 8 am and in the evenings from 5 to 6pm on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, while women ride the most on the weekends from 10 am to 6 pm. Our customers prefer riding for short periods of time - both men and women. For our future analysis it would be very interesting to find out more about our customers' demographic  - we do have our birth year column in the data set. In addition to that, we can also add gender as a second criterion (in addition to the birth date mentioned above) and see what we can find. This can help us tailor our services - for example, we may offer discounted subscription rates for students and people over 55 if it makes any business sense.
